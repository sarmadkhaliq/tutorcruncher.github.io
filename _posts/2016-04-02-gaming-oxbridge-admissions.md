So you are a parent looking to get your child into one of the UK’s best universities? You have done all the leg work - you have sent them to a great private school to, supplemented by some additional private tutoring. You’ve done everything right, provided the good results are forthcoming your pride and joy has just as much chance as anyone else of getting into the Oxford or Cambridge college of their choice?

You might think so, but a recent chat with a Cambridge don who did admissions revealed that a lot of other factors play a significant part. I asked, what does the ideal Cambridge candidate look like, in terms of having the best chance of getting in? His answer was simple - a candidate with the maximum chance of getting in would:

#### 1. Be privately educated at an elite school, but then have attended a state sixth form and invested the money they saved on private tuition.

Private schools undeniably do a fantastic job but universities are under pressure to balance their books in terms of state/private entrants. But institutions do not take a potted educational history into account, merely the type of school you attend right now. Therefore, swapping out to a state sixth form could be a smart move.

#### 2. Have done traditional A-level subjects.

The universities have an unofficial black list of subjects which they deem either un-academic or soft options. They include Art, Drama, Psychology, Sociology. Much safer (and more impressive) to excel at Maths, hard sciences, history, english, languages, etc.

#### 3. Apply for Art History, Classics, or Music particularly if you fulfil option 1.

A couple of subjects, for historic reasons, are particularly dominated by private school entrants, like those listed. If you apply as a credible state school applicant then colleges will be queuing up. Some subjects have an acceptance rate of less than 10% whereas in classics you have almost a 1 in 2 chance.

#### 4. Apply to a subject where their gender is underrepresented.

There has been a gender disparity between some arts and science subjects for many years, but now universities are under pressure to address this. A girl applying to computer science or physics, or a boy applying to history of art or modern languages.


There are more nuanced factors in terms of college and subject choice/combination which also make a difference. But if your priority is gaining that place, you need to buy some quality advice and many tutoring companies are more than willing to oblige.
