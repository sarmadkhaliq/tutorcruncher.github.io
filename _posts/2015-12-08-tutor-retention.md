Most tutoring companies actually function as tutoring agencies - they connect self-employed tutors with clients looking to hire them and either provide a way for the two parties to communicate, or do that communication themselves. After an initial encounter, what is to stop tutors cutting out the agency and their agency fee and taking a better salary for themselves?

The short answer is nothing. One must take another approach - agencies must prove their ongoing worth to their tutors, and the service they provide must go far beyond a mere fixing service.

One of the main issues with working freelance is invoicing and payment. As a tutor you cannot separate the tutoring from payment, so the relationship with the client can get a bit tricky. Having a third party collecting payment for you however, takes that awkwardness away and lets you focus on just the teaching. Taking the payment itself can also be problematic, as you are left taking payment by cheque, cash or bank transfer. The first is inconvenient for both parties, the second presents tax-issues and the third is inconvenient for the client. And with all you may end up with problems with non-payment. Agencies using TutorCruncher take all of those problems out of the tutor’s hands and give a positive reason to keep your work on the agencies books - clients get the additional convenience of card payment using [Stripe](www.stripe.com).

The other main and obvious advantage of staying with an agency is the work you receive. Agencies are attentive to everything that goes on, and with software like TutorCruncher making the process simpler by [showing agencies how long it’s been since a lesson is logged](http://help.tutorcruncher.com/scheduling/#how-do-i-filter-the-jobs-list), they can see if the tutor has decided to go it alone, and that tutor is likely to find themselves unable to get any more work from the agency.
