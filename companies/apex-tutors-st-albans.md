APEX Tutors' aim is to provide quality private tuition on a one-to-one basis at a competitive price. This has been the
philosophy since the principals, who are qualified teachers, started the agency in 1980. They do not book on-line since
they firmly believe it is better to speak to the parent or adult responsible, in order to establish exactly what their
particular request is and discuss the pupil's needs. This way they can offer advice as every individual is different and
they try to match the right tutor for the pupil.
