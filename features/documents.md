Documents can be uploaded by administrators, tutors, clients, and students, and can be given specific viewing permissions.

Documents can be uploaded for specific jobs, lessons, and users and are available to be viewed or downloaded by the user.

For example, tutors can upload a document for specific students to view or download and the students can upload the revised document
for tutors who can then also view or download the document.

Also, as the administrator, if you have other resources for a specific job that you want to be made available to tutors and/or
students/clients, you can upload them onto the job.
