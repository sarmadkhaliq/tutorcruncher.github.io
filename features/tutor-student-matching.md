Finding the perfect tutor for a client and student's need is a hugely important part of running an effective tutoring agency, so we've made it easy for you.

<h3 id="filter-tutors">Filter tutors by subjects</h3>

When tutors fill in their profiles they are asked to fill int he skills they can teach. TutorCruncher allows you to filter the tutors by one or more skills so you can find a match for your requirements.

<h3 id="tutors-apply">Get your tutors to apply for available jobs</h3>

Allow your tutors to be proactive by creating jobs as Available for Application. This means they can view them on a jobs board when they log in.

</a>

<h3 id="specify-skills">Specify required skills on a job</h3>

If a job is available for application, you can specify what skills are needed to apply. For instance, if a client requires a tutor to teach A Level sciences, then you can specify that applicable tutors must be able to have Biology, Chemistry and Physics at A Level as teaching skills.

</a>

<h3 id="send-notifications">Send notifications to tutors</h3>

Instead of your tutors logging in to view the available jobs, you can send out notifications via email to encourage them to apply. The email that the tutor receives contains a link to the application, making the whole process as quick as possible.

### Send notifications by a radius

New to TutorCruncher is the ability to send notifications by a location's radius. Simply set the default location on a job and you can send notifications to only tutors with any radius you decide.
