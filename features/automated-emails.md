### Automated emails

TutorCruncher can send emails for almost anything you do in TutorCruncher, including sending invoices, welcoming tutors and clients, letting tutors know a new job is available and inviting them in for an interview. These actions are recorded, so you know who you sent an email to and when.

<h3 id="email-analytics">Email analytics</h3>

With email analytics you can see exactly how well your emails are received. This is a huge asset to your marketing campaigns, as you can see who opens your emails, how many people mark your emails as spam and more. You can even view the content of old emails to make sure that sent the right email to the right person.

<h3 id="broadcasts">Broadcasts</h3>

You can use TutorCruncher to mass email your clients or tutors with Broadcasts. You can choose whether to send an email all or some of your clients or tutors, so you could easily create a marketing campaign to send to all of your clients in a certain area, or with children who are taking 11+ in the next, or perhaps send an email to all approved tutors to ask them to update their profiles. Then, with [Email Analytics](#email-analytics) you can see how successful the campaign is.
