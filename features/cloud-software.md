We make sure that every page in the system loads as quick as possible, which means that when we compared TutorCruncher to the top 10 websites around the world, the only one that beats us for speed is google.com.

<h3 id="secure-data">Your data is secure</h3>

At TutorCruncher security is our top priority. Our system is hosted with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security) on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/security/), which is used by companies of all sizes around the world.

The data centre operations have been accredited under:

+ ISO 27001
+ SOC 1 and SOC 2/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (Previously SAS 70 Type II)
+ PCI Level 1
+ FISMA Moderate
+ Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)

More information on Heroku and AWS can be found at [https://www.heroku.com/policy/security](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security) and [https://aws.amazon.com/security/](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

Our user passwords are hashed using [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2), with a 256-bit SHA, so you can be sure that your data is safe.

If you have any other questions about security, please email [support@tutorcruncher.com](mailto:support@tutorcruncher.com) and we will answer any questions.
