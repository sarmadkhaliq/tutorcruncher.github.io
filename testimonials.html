        "Quintessentially Education has found TutorCruncher to be a highly effective system which has transformed the way we are able to manage both clients and tutors. By having all tutors’ and clients’ data in one place, it has enabled the business to run smoothly and grow. The lesson logging and reporting is highly efficient and  allows us to keep an eye on our tutor placements without having to interfere, which is appreciated by both tutors and clients. The invoicing system is simple and works brilliantly, and the new Stripe integration is a fantastic addition which we are looking forward to setting up. The system is backed up by the wonderful Tutorcruncher team who could not be more helpful."
